Combined Degree/Diploma

Complete a Bachelor of Technology in 4.5 years in one of three program specializations: Automotive & Vehicle Engineering Technology, Biotechnology, or Automation Engineering Technology. This program is designed for students graduating from high school or recently graduated.
What is the Bachelor of Technology program?
The Walter G Booth School of Engineering Practice and Technology offers skills-based engineering technology education at the university level.

BTech is a four and a half year post-secondary program that takes a fresh approach to education for the dynamic world of engineering. Combining classroom studies in technology and management with labs and co-op experience, you will graduate with both a university degree from McMaster University, as well as an advanced diploma and certificate from Mohawk College.

The program is ideal for students who:

like science, math, and computers;
learn best by doing;
are interested in business and management;
prefer hands-on lab environments; and,
are analytical and want to know “how” things work
BTech was developed in consultation with employers to ensure that our graduates meet the needs of the engineering industry today. With a Bachelor of Technology Degree, Advanced Diploma in Technology, and Certificate in Business Management, you’ll be ready to step directly into a career that lets you move between the shop floor and the executive suite. Alternatively, you can pursue additional studies, including Master’s and Ph.D. programs.

The three programs offered at the four-year level are:

Automation Engineering Technology
Automotive & Vehicle Engineering Technology
Biotechnology
The McMaster-Mohawk Bachelor of Technology program is the first of its kind in Canada. You won’t find a program like this anywhere else!

Where is BTech located
Lectures and labs are typically held at McMaster University in the state-of-the-art Engineering Technology Building (ETB); however, some upper year labs will be held on Mohawk College campuses.

The BTech program administrative offices, as well as academic advising services and co-op and career services are located on the McMaster University campus.

Students will have access to clubs and student organizations, as well as academic and support facilities at both McMaster University and Mohawk College

What will it say on my degree when I graduate
Students are conferred a four-year Bachelor of Technology degree from McMaster University. Those who achieve a minimum Cumulative Average of 9.5 out of 12 in the program will receive the status of “Graduation with Distinction.”

Students are also awarded advanced diploma in Technology and a certificate in Business Management from Mohawk College in recognition of the skills-based learning completed and management competencies acquired as part of the BTech program.
Will I be eligible for graduate school?
Yes, after completing the program, eligible student may apply for Master of Business Administration, Master of Science in Engineering, Master of Applied Science in Engineering, and Master of Engineering. Admission to these programs is highly dependent upon the academic achievement of the student throughout their undergraduate degree.
Why does the program have so much emphasis on "management"?
The business and management component of BTech prepares graduates to advance their careers to management and supervisory levels. It also gives graduates an upper hand in industry, allowing them to offer transferable skills that go beyond their subject specialization. Students learn about financial systems, project management, entrepreneurship, and organizational behaviours – all in a technological context. These courses also help to pursue additional university studies in management, such as a Master of Business Administration.
Can I transfer from BTech to BEng degree at McMaster?
It is possible to switch from our BTech program into Engineering I after first year, however it is very competitive and students would need to perform very well to be considered (specific eligibility will be done on a case-by-case basis, and depends on your Grade Point Average relative to other students requesting transfer into Engineering I). There are very limited spots available (typically less than ten) for transfer students from BTech to Engineering I, so this limited enrolment makes competition very keen. Additionally, our students would be required to begin in Engineering I, regardless of the courses they have taken in BTech as students will not be granted transfer credit for any completed courses.
How long does the program take to complete??
BTech is a four-year academic degree program that requires 8 academic terms (typically two academic terms a year) of academic study; however, because we have 12 months of co-op work terms integrated into the program structure, students usually graduate after four and a half years.

A detailed outline of our program structure is shown on every stream page (Automotive & Vehicle Engineering Technology, Biotechnology and Automation Engineering Technology).
What courses would I take in the first year?
You are encouraged to refer to our Academic Calendar to see what courses are taken in the first-year of our BTech program! Students can also visit the Faculty of Engineering Academic Advising website – Your First Year page for information about courses and enrollment.
How big are the class sizes in the BTech program?
Classes are approximately 80 students in size!
Do I need to know coding and programming prior to starting university?
Programming experience is not necessary for admission to the BTech program. If you would like to get some practice in advance or are curious about coding, check out Codecademy, a site that teaches you how to code (for free!) in a variety of languages.
What is the best laptop for BTech?
We definitely strongly recommend a laptop for the ease, flexibility and portability! Also, Windows instead of a Mac would be ideal.
What elective and minors can I pursue in BTech?
Bachelor of Technology students follow a set schedule from day one. Electives are not a required part of the program and therefore, there is no option to pursue a minor.
