Hey, can you walk me through all the plans you have and give me a recommendation?I'm a big gamer
ok, now could you recommend a cheap plan to fulfill the least internet need?
Hey, i know nothing about internet, I just use it to read news and stream movies.

features: superfast, latest gpt model, product catalog integrated, almost accurate recommendation



continuous dialog: is there a cheaper plan 

limitation: unstable response each time, based on openai server status, response could be fairly slow...
limitation: feed data/prompt to system/user/assistant could end up in different senario

opinion: AI should build trust with customer first, might not stimulate purchasing if it only generates these plans, point to think.

Hey, I just need an internet plan with the speed of watching videos and surfing websites, no heavy lifting here, can you recommend the cheap plan for this matter?
